# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## backend-backend-v1.1.1

### Status
Accepted

### Context
This ADR documents the changes made to the backend workflow in the Competency Mapping project. The changes include the implementation of automated deployments, improved branch syncing, and updates to the release workflow.

### Problem Statement
The existing backend workflow was manual and prone to errors. The team wanted to automate the deployment process and improve the overall efficiency of the development cycle.

### Decision Drivers
- Improve development efficiency
- Reduce manual errors
- Enhance collaboration among team members
- Automate deployments for improved reliability

### Considered Options
- Manual deployments with GitHub Actions
- Automated deployments with GitHub Actions and semantic release
- Use of a separate deployment tool
- Manual deployments with a custom script

### Decision Outcome
The team decided to implement automated deployments using GitHub Actions and semantic release. This decision was driven by the need to improve development efficiency, reduce manual errors, and enhance collaboration among team members.

### Pros & Cons
**Pros:**

- Improved development efficiency
- Reduced manual errors
- Enhanced collaboration among team members
- Automated deployments for improved reliability

**Cons:**

- Initial setup and configuration required
- Potential for errors in automated deployments
- Dependence on GitHub Actions and semantic release

### Consequences
The implementation of automated deployments using GitHub Actions and semantic release has improved the development efficiency and reduced manual errors. The team can now focus on writing code and testing, rather than manually deploying the application.

### Implementation Notes
The implementation involved the following steps:

- Configuring GitHub Actions to automate deployments
- Setting up semantic release for automated release notes and changelogs
- Updating the release workflow to use semantic release
- Testing the automated deployment process

### Rollback Plan
In case of any issues with the automated deployment process, the team can roll back to the previous manual deployment process. This involves disabling the GitHub Actions workflow and reverting to manual deployments.

### Security Considerations
The automated deployment process uses GitHub Actions and semantic release, which are secure and widely used tools. However, the team should ensure that the repository URL and API keys are secure and not exposed to unauthorized access.

### Testing Strategy
The team will test the automated deployment process by deploying the application manually and verifying that it works as expected. They will also test the automated release notes and changelogs generated by semantic release.

### Future Improvements
The team plans to improve the automated deployment process by:

- Integrating with other tools and services
- Adding more features to the release workflow
- Improving the security and reliability of the automated deployment process
