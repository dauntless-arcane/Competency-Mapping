## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this ADR is to document the architectural changes and decisions made in the commits mentioned above. This includes understanding the context, identifying the problem, and documenting the decision-making process.

## Decision Drivers
The decision drivers for this ADR are:

- To improve the functionality of the metrics system
- To enhance the performance and reliability of the backend
- To maintain consistency across the codebase

## Considered Options
The considered options for this ADR are:

- Refactoring the metrics system to improve performance and reliability
- Enhancing the function timing histogram to provide more detailed insights
- Improving the route label helper to make it more user-friendly

## Decision Outcome
The decision outcome for this ADR is to refactor the metrics system, enhance the function timing histogram, and improve the route label helper. This decision is based on the need to improve the functionality and performance of the backend.

## Pros & Cons
The pros of this decision are:

- Improved performance and reliability of the backend
- Enhanced functionality of the metrics system
- Consistency across the codebase

The cons of this decision are:

- Additional development time and effort required
- Potential for bugs or issues introduced during refactoring

## Consequences
The consequences of this decision are:

- Improved user experience and satisfaction
- Increased trust and confidence in the backend system
- Enhanced ability to monitor and analyze system performance

## Implementation Notes
The implementation notes for this ADR are:

- Refactor the metrics system to use a more efficient data structure
- Enhance the function timing histogram to include additional metrics
- Improve the route label helper to make it more user-friendly

## Rollback Plan
The rollback plan for this ADR is:

- Identify the specific changes made during the refactor
- Create a patch to revert the changes
- Apply the patch to the main branch

## Security Considerations
The security considerations for this ADR are:

- Ensure that the refactored metrics system does not introduce any security vulnerabilities
- Verify that the enhanced function timing histogram does not expose sensitive information
- Review the improved route label helper to ensure it does not introduce any security risks

## Testing Strategy
The testing strategy for this ADR is:

- Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the refactored metrics system
- Write integration tests to verify the enhanced function timing histogram
- Write UI tests to verify the improved route label helper

## Future Improvements
The future improvements for this ADR are:

- Continuously monitor and analyze system performance to identify areas for improvement
- Enhance the metrics system to include additional features and functionality
