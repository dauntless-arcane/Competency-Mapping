### Why it likely changed

The changes were likely made to resolve merge conflicts between the backend branch and the main branch. The auto-sync process updated the CHANGELOG.md file to reflect the changes made in the backend branch, including bug fixes, features, and breaking changes.

### Impact on system

The changes should have a minimal impact on the system, as they primarily involve updating the CHANGELOG.md file and resolving merge conflicts. However, the breaking change to the `POST /api/users/entry` endpoint may require updates to client-side code that interacts with this endpoint.

### Possible risks

* The breaking change to the `POST /api/users/entry` endpoint may cause issues with client-side code that does not account for the new payload format.
* The updated dependencies in the package-lock.json file may introduce new security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues.

### Migration notes

* Update client-side code to account for the new payload format for the `POST /api/users/entry` endpoint.
* Review the updated dependencies in the package-lock.json file to ensure they do not introduce any security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues.

### Test recommendations

* Test the `POST /api/users/entry` endpoint with the new payload format to ensure that it works correctly.
* Verify that the updated dependencies in the package-lock.json file do not cause any issues with the system.

### Final release note
