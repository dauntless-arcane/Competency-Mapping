### 1. High-level summary
This commit is a merge of pull request #9, which includes fixes to the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint to add level, duration, and recommended fields.

### 2. What changed
* The `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint now includes level, duration, and recommended fields in its response.
* The code changes are not explicitly shown in the diff, but the commit message indicates that the changes are related to adding these fields.

### 3. Why it likely changed
The changes likely occurred to enhance the functionality of the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint, providing more detailed information about the tests, such as their level, duration, and whether they are recommended.

### 4. Impact on system
The impact on the system is likely minimal, as the changes only add new fields to an existing endpoint. However, this may affect any downstream systems or applications that rely on this endpoint and are not expecting the new fields.

### 5. Possible risks
Possible risks include:
* Compatibility issues with downstream systems or applications that are not expecting the new fields.
* Potential errors in the implementation of the new fields, which could affect the accuracy or reliability of the data returned by the endpoint.

### 6. Migration notes (if needed)
No explicit migration notes are needed, as the changes are additive and do not appear to require any significant modifications to existing code or systems.

### 7. Test recommendations
Recommended tests include:
* Unit tests to verify that the new fields are being added correctly to the response.
* Integration tests to ensure that the endpoint is returning the expected data, including the new fields.
* End-to-end tests to verify that the changes do not affect the overall functionality of the system.

### 8. Final release note
Added level, duration, and recommended fields to the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint.
