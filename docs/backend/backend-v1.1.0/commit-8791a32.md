* The project may need to configure the `@semantic-release/changelog` dependency to work with its existing release process.
* There may be issues with the changelog generation process that need to be addressed.

### Migration Notes (if needed)

* Update the project's release process to accommodate the use of semantic release.
* Configure the `@semantic-release/changelog` dependency to work with the project's existing release process.
* Test the changelog generation process to ensure it is working correctly.

### Test Recommendations
