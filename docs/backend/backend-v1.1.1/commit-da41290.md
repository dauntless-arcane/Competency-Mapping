### High-level summary

A commit was made to remove an outdated CHANGELOG.md file from the backend of the Competency-Mapping project.

### What changed

* The CHANGELOG.md file in the backend directory was deleted.
* The sync-main.yml workflow file was updated to remove a line that was commented out.

### Why it likely changed

The CHANGELOG.md file was likely outdated because it contained information about previous releases and changes that are no longer relevant. The commit message suggests that the file was removed as part of a chore to clean up the project.

### Impact on system

The removal of the CHANGELOG.md file will likely have a minimal impact on the system, as it was not being actively used or referenced elsewhere in the project. However, it may cause issues if other parts of the project are still referencing the file.

### Possible risks

* If other parts of the project are still referencing the CHANGELOG.md file, removing it may cause errors or inconsistencies.
* If the file was being used as a reference for future releases, its removal may cause issues with release planning and management.

### Migration notes (if needed)

* If other parts of the project are still referencing the CHANGELOG.md file, they should be updated to reference the current CHANGELOG.md file or a different source of information.
* If the file was being used as a reference for future releases, a new system for tracking releases and changes should be established.

### Test recommendations

* Run a thorough test of the project to ensure that the removal of the CHANGELOG.md file has not caused any issues.
* Verify that all parts of the project that were referencing the CHANGELOG.md file have been updated to reference the current CHANGELOG.md file or a different source of information.
