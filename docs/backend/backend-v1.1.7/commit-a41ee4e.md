### High-level summary

This commit introduces full backend support for the Big Five Personality Test by adding test data and a dynamic scoring engine. The changes include adding a new data set, updating the scoring pipeline to handle different scoring methods, and implementing a reusable scoring action function.

### What changed (bullet points)

* Added the 50-question IPIP-NEO Big Five dataset to the data set.
* Updated the `TestsSchema` model to include new fields for scoring method, steps, and category constants.
* Implemented a new scoring pipeline engine in `utils/resultGenerator.js` that can handle different scoring methods and steps.
* Created a reusable scoring action function in `utils/scoringActions.js` that can be used in the scoring pipeline.
* Updated the `generateResultFromSurvey` function to use the new scoring pipeline engine and reusable scoring action function.

### Why it likely changed

The changes were likely made to support the Big Five Personality Test, which requires a more complex scoring system than the previous tests. The new scoring pipeline engine and reusable scoring action function were likely added to make it easier to handle different scoring methods and steps.

### Impact on system

The changes will likely have a positive impact on the system by:

* Enabling the Big Five Personality Test to be scored correctly
* Providing a more flexible and scalable scoring system
* Allowing for easier maintenance and updates of the scoring pipeline

### Possible risks

Possible risks associated with these changes include:

* Errors in the scoring pipeline engine or reusable scoring action function that could lead to incorrect scores
* Incompatibility with existing tests or scoring methods
* Performance issues due to the increased complexity of the scoring system

### Migration notes (if needed)

No migration notes are necessary for this change, as it is a new feature that does not affect existing tests or scoring methods.

### Test recommendations

To ensure the correctness of the new scoring pipeline engine and reusable scoring action function, the following tests should be written:

* Unit tests for the scoring pipeline engine and reusable scoring action function
* Integration tests that cover different scoring methods and steps
* End-to-end tests that verify the correctness of the scores generated by the new scoring pipeline engine
