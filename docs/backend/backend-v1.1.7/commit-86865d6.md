### High-level summary

The commit removes the `node_modules` directory from version control, which is a common practice to avoid checking in unnecessary files and to improve repository size. This change likely occurred to simplify the repository and make it easier to manage.

### What changed

* Removed the `node_modules` directory from version control
* Updated the `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` directory
* Deleted several files that were likely generated by the `node_modules` directory, including:
	+ `.eslintrc.json`
	+ `.github/workflows/backend-release.yml`
	+ `.github/workflows/frontend-release.yml`
	+ `.releaserc.json`
	+ `app/admin/page.tsx`
	+ `app/auth/login/page.tsx`

### Why it likely changed

The change likely occurred to simplify the repository and make it easier to manage. By removing the `node_modules` directory from version control, the repository size is reduced, and the number of files to manage is decreased. This makes it easier to clone the repository, update dependencies, and perform other tasks.

### Impact on system

The change should not have a significant impact on the system, as the `node_modules` directory is not a critical component of the application. However, it may affect the build process, as the `node_modules` directory is typically used to install dependencies. To mitigate this, the project may need to update its build scripts to install dependencies before building the application.

### Possible risks

* If the `node_modules` directory is not properly removed, it may cause issues with the build process or other parts of the application.
* If the project relies on specific versions of dependencies, removing the `node_modules` directory may cause version conflicts.

### Migration notes

* To migrate to this change, the project should update its build scripts to install dependencies before building the application.
* The project should also update its `.gitignore` file to ignore the `node_modules` directory.

### Test recommendations

* Run a full test suite to ensure that the application still functions correctly after removing the `node_modules` directory.
* Test the build process to ensure that it still works correctly after removing the `node_modules` directory.

### Final release note

"Removed `node_modules` directory from version control to simplify repository management."
