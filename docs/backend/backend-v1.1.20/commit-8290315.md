### Commit Analysis

#### 1. High-level summary
This commit is an automated merge from the backend branch to the main branch, indicating a synchronization of changes from the backend to the main codebase.

#### 2. What changed (bullet points)
* The commit is an automated merge from the backend branch to the main branch.
* No specific code changes are mentioned in the diff, as this is an auto-merge commit.

#### 3. Why it likely changed
The commit was likely triggered by a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the synchronization of changes from the backend branch to the main branch. This is a common practice in software development to ensure that the main branch always reflects the latest changes from the development branches.

#### 4. Impact on system
The impact of this commit is likely minimal, as it is an auto-merge commit that does not introduce any new code changes. However, it may affect the build or deployment process if the backend branch has introduced any changes that are not yet compatible with the main branch.

#### 5. Possible risks
The possible risks associated with this commit are:
