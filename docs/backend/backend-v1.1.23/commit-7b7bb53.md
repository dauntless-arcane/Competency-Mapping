### Commit Analysis

#### 1. High-level summary
This commit is an automated merge from the backend branch to the main branch, indicating a synchronization of changes from the backend to the main codebase.

#### 2. What changed (bullet points)
* The commit is an automated merge from the backend branch to the main branch.
* No specific code changes are mentioned in the diff, suggesting that the merge was successful and no conflicts were encountered.

#### 3. Why it likely changed
The commit was likely triggered by a GitHub Actions workflow, which automates the process of merging changes from the backend branch to the main branch.
