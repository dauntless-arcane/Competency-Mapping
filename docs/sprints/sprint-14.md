#### Subject: 🔁 Sync from backend → main (auto-merge)

### High-level Summary
This commit is an automated merge from the backend branch to the main branch, indicating a synchronization of changes from the backend to the main codebase.

### What Changed
* The commit message indicates a synchronization of changes from the backend to the main branch.
* The exact changes are not specified in the provided diff, but it likely includes updates to the main branch to reflect the latest changes from the backend.

### Why it Likely Changed
The commit was likely triggered by a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the synchronization of changes from the backend to the main branch. This is a common practice in software development to ensure that the main branch always reflects the latest changes and is ready for deployment.

### Impact on System
The synchronization of changes from the backend to the main branch will likely update the main branch with the latest features, bug fixes, and improvements from the backend. This will ensure that the main branch is up-to-date and ready for deployment.

### Possible Risks
* The automated merge may introduce conflicts or issues if the changes from the backend are not properly tested or reviewed.
* The synchronization may overwrite changes made to the main branch since the last synchronization, potentially losing work.

### Migration Notes
No migration notes are required for this commit, as it is an automated merge and does not involve any significant changes to the codebase.

### Test Recommendations
* Review the changes made to the main branch to ensure they are correct and do not introduce any issues.
* Run automated tests to verify that the changes do not break any existing functionality.
* Perform manual testing to ensure that the changes work as expected.

### Final Release Note
