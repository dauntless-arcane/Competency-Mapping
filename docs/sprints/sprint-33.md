### Commit Detail
### High-level summary

The commit `8a8c77e768877283a71ea8d180266bf057026e18` made by author dauntless-arcane on November 12, 2025, updates the version of the `next` package from `16.0.0` to `13.5.1` in the project's `package.json` file.

### What changed

* Updated the version of the `next` package from `16.0.0` to `13.5.1` in the `package.json` file.

### Why it likely changed

It is likely that the version of `next` was updated to a lower version (`13.5.1`) due to compatibility issues or bugs in the newer version (`16.0.0`). This change may have been made to resolve issues or prevent future problems in the project.

### Impact on system

Updating the `next` package to a lower version may have the following impacts:

* Resolves compatibility issues or bugs in the newer version
* May break existing features or functionality that relied on the newer version
* Could introduce new features or improvements in the lower version

### Possible risks

* Breaking existing features or functionality that relied on the newer version
* Introducing new bugs or issues in the lower version
* Potential loss of functionality or features that were available in the newer version

### Migration notes (if needed)

If the project relies heavily on features or functionality that were available in the newer version, it may be necessary to:

* Review and update code that relies on the newer version
* Test thoroughly to ensure that existing features and functionality still work as expected
* Consider reverting to the newer version if issues are encountered

### Test recommendations

* Run a full suite of tests to ensure that existing features and functionality still work as expected
* Test new features and functionality that may have been introduced in the lower version
* Consider running tests in a staging or development environment before deploying to production

### Final release note

---
### Commit Detail
### Deep Commit Analysis

#### 1. High-level summary

This commit fixes two issues in the application's navigation and API fetch functionality. It corrects the syntax of the API fetch URL and updates the navigation path to the results page.

#### 2. What changed (bullet points)

* Corrected the syntax of the API fetch URL in `app/result/page.tsx` from `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/users/result/testuser/` to `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/users/result/testuser/` (removed unnecessary backticks)
* Updated the navigation path to the results page in `app/test/page.tsx` from `/results` to `/result`

#### 3. Why it likely changed

The changes were likely made to fix a bug or issue in the application. The incorrect API fetch URL syntax may have caused errors or unexpected behavior, while the outdated navigation path may have led to incorrect routing.

#### 4. Impact on system

The changes should have a positive impact on the system by fixing the bugs and ensuring that the application functions as expected. However, it's possible that the changes may introduce new issues or side effects, especially if the corrected API fetch URL or navigation path interacts with other parts of the system in unexpected ways.

#### 5. Possible risks

* The changes may break existing integrations or dependencies that relied on the previous API fetch URL or navigation path.
* The corrected API fetch URL may introduce new security risks if it exposes sensitive data or endpoints to unauthorized access.
* The updated navigation path may cause confusion among users if it changes the expected behavior or routing of the application.

#### 6. Migration notes (if needed)

No specific migration notes are required for this commit, as it only corrects existing issues and updates the navigation path. However, it's essential to review the changes and test the application thoroughly to ensure that they don't introduce new issues or side effects.

#### 7. Test recommendations

To ensure that the changes are correct and don't introduce new issues, it's recommended to perform the following tests:

* Unit testing: Test the API fetch functionality in isolation to ensure that it works correctly with the corrected URL.
* Integration testing: Test the navigation path and API fetch functionality together to ensure that they work as expected.
* End-to-end testing: Test the entire application flow to ensure that the changes don't break existing functionality or introduce new issues.

### Commit Detail
### Deep Commit Analysis

#### 1. High-level summary

This commit refactors the `ChartTooltipContent` props in the `components/ui/chart.tsx` file to address issues related to Vercel deployment.

#### 2. What changed

* Added an import statement for `TooltipProps` from "recharts"
* Defined a new type `FixedTooltipProps` that extends `TooltipProps` and adds additional props
* Updated the type of `ChartTooltipContent` to use `FixedTooltipProps` instead of the previous type
* No code changes were made to the `ChartTooltipContent` component itself

#### 3. Why it likely changed

The change was likely made to address issues related to Vercel deployment, which is a serverless platform that requires strict adherence to type definitions. By importing the `TooltipProps` type from "recharts" and defining a new type `FixedTooltipProps` that extends it, the code becomes more type-safe and compatible with Vercel's requirements.

#### 4. Impact on system

The change should have a positive impact on the system by making it more type-safe and compatible with Vercel's requirements. This should help prevent errors and issues related to type mismatches or undefined props.

#### 5. Possible risks

There is a small risk that the change may break existing code that relies on the previous type definition of `ChartTooltipContent`. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that the type definition has been updated to be more specific and accurate.

#### 6. Migration notes (if needed)

No migration notes are necessary, as the change is backward-compatible and does not require any changes to existing code.

#### 7. Test recommendations

It is recommended to run a full suite of tests to ensure that the change has not introduced any regressions or issues.

#### 8. Final release note

"Refactored ChartTooltipContent props to address Vercel deployment issues and improve type safety."

* Updated the type of `ChartTooltipContent` to use `FixedTooltipProps` instead of the previous type
* No code changes were made to the `ChartTooltipContent` component itself

### Why it Likely Changed

The change was likely made to address issues related to Vercel deployment, which is a serverless platform that requires strict adherence to type definitions. By importing the `TooltipProps` type from "recharts" and defining a new type `FixedTooltipProps` that extends it, the code becomes more type-safe and compatible with Vercel's requirements.

### Impact on System

The change should have a positive impact on the system by making it more type-safe and compatible with Vercel's requirements. This should help prevent errors and issues related to type mismatches or undefined props.

### Possible Risks

There is a small risk that the change may break existing code that relies on the previous type definition of `ChartTooltipContent`. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that the type definition has been updated to be more specific and accurate.

### Migration Notes

No migration notes are necessary, as the change is backward-compatible and does not require any changes to existing code.

### Test Recommendations

It is recommended to run a full suite of tests to ensure that the change has not introduced any regressions or issues.

### Final Release Note

"Refactored ChartTooltipContent props to address Vercel deployment issues and improve type safety."

#### Subject: Feat: Implement API Integration and User Roles in Auth Pages

### High-level Summary

This commit introduces API integration and user roles in the authentication pages of the application. It replaces mock authentication logic with a real backend API and adds functionality to store access tokens in memory. User roles are now determined by the API response, and the application redirects to different pages based on the user's role.

### What Changed

* Replaced mock authentication with an asynchronous fetch call to `${API_BASE}/login` in `app/auth/login/page.tsx`.
* Updated `formData` to use `username` instead of `email` and removed the role selection in `app/auth/login/page.tsx`.
* Implemented client-side storage of the access token in memory using `setAccessToken` in `app/auth/login/page.tsx`.
* Added state for displaying `apiError` messages in `app/auth/login/page.tsx`.
* Redirects based on user roles (`/admin` or `/dashboard`) received in the response in `app/auth/login/page.tsx`.
* Removed role selection and added student-specific registration fields: `username`, `class`, `section`, `rollNo`, and `dob` in `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`.
* Updated form data handling and validation in `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`.
* Integrated the new `apiClient` utility for making authenticated requests in the following pages:
	+ `app/result/page.tsx`
	+ `app/results/page.tsx`
	+ `app/test/page.tsx`
	+ `app/tests/page.tsx`

### Why it Likely Changed

The changes were likely made to improve the security and functionality of the application's authentication system. By integrating a real backend API, the application can now authenticate users securely and store access tokens in memory. The addition of user roles and student-specific registration fields also enhances the application's functionality and user experience.

### Impact on System

The changes will impact the following:

* Authentication system: The new API integration will replace the mock authentication logic, making the system more secure and functional.
* User experience: The addition of user roles and student-specific registration fields will enhance the user experience and provide a more personalized experience for users.
* System scalability: The new API integration will allow the system to scale more efficiently and handle a larger number of users.

### Possible Risks

* API integration issues: There may be issues with the API integration, such as incorrect API endpoints or authentication errors.
* Security vulnerabilities: The new API integration may introduce new security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.
* System downtime: The changes may cause system downtime if not properly tested and deployed.

### Migration Notes

* Ensure that the API integration is properly tested and deployed to avoid any issues.
* Update the `tsconfig.json` file to change `"jsx"` from `"preserve"` to `"react-jsx"` as mentioned in the commit message.
* Verify that the system is properly handling user roles and student-specific registration fields.

### Test Recommendations

* Unit tests: Write unit tests to ensure that the API integration and user roles functionality are working correctly.
* Integration tests: Write integration tests to ensure that the system is properly handling API requests and user roles.
* End-to-end tests: Write end-to-end tests to ensure that the system is working correctly from a user's perspective.

### Final Release Note

"Implemented API integration and user roles in authentication pages to enhance system security and functionality."
