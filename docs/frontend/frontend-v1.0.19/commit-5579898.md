### Commit Analysis

#### High-level summary

This commit updates the score type to number in various components and adjusts related logic for consistency.

#### What changed

* Updated score type to number in `Trait` interface in `app/results/page.tsx`, `components/result-models/OceanTest-Result.tsx`, and `components/result-models/riasec-result.tsx`
* Updated `ResultRadarChart` component to accept `maxValue` prop in `app/results/page.tsx`
* Updated `migrateSavedAnswers` function to handle string scores in `app/test/page.tsx`
* Updated `ChartTooltip` and `ChartLegend` components to handle number scores in `components/ui/chart.tsx`
* Updated `getPayloadConfigFromPayload` function to handle number scores in `components/ui/chart.tsx`

#### Why it likely changed

The score type was likely changed to number to improve consistency and accuracy in calculations and comparisons. This change may have been necessary due to issues with string scores, such as incorrect sorting or comparison.

#### Impact on system

This change should improve the accuracy and consistency of score calculations and comparisons in the system. However, it may also introduce issues if the system relies on string scores in certain places.

#### Possible risks

* Issues with string scores in certain places, such as sorting or comparison
* Potential data loss or corruption if scores are not properly converted to numbers
* Impact on system performance if large amounts of data need to be converted to numbers

#### Migration notes

* Review all places where scores are used to ensure they are properly converted to numbers
* Test the system thoroughly to ensure scores are being calculated and compared correctly
* Consider adding checks to handle string scores in certain places

#### Test recommendations

* Test score calculations and comparisons with both string and number scores
* Test the system with large amounts of data to ensure performance is not impacted
* Test the system with edge cases, such as scores that are very large or very small

#### Final release note

"Updated score type to number in various components for consistency and accuracy."

### Full Code Explanation

The code changes in this commit are primarily focused on updating the score type to number in various components and adjusting related logic for consistency.

In `app/results/page.tsx`, the `Trait` interface is updated to include a `score` property of type `number`. This change is also reflected in the `FullResult` interface.

In `components/result-models/OceanTest-Result.tsx` and `components/result-models/riasec-result.tsx`, the `Trait` interface is updated to include a `score` property of type `number`.

In `app/test/page.tsx`, the `migrateSavedAnswers` function is updated to handle string scores by parsing them as numbers.

In `components/ui/chart.tsx`, the `ChartTooltip` and `ChartLegend` components are updated to handle number scores. The `getPayloadConfigFromPayload` function is also updated to handle number scores.

Overall, these changes aim to improve the accuracy and consistency of score calculations and comparisons in the system. However, they may also introduce issues if the system relies on string scores in certain places.
