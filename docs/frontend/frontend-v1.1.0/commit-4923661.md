#### Subject: Merge pull request #9 from Mpratyush54/main

### High-level Summary
This commit merges pull request #9 from the main branch, which fixes an issue in the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint by adding three new fields: `level`, `duration`, and `recommended`.

### What Changed
* Added `level`, `duration`, and `recommended` fields to the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint.

### Why it Likely Changed
The change was made to enhance the functionality of the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint by providing additional information to users. This could be in response to user feedback or to improve the overall user experience.

### Impact on System
The addition of these new fields will likely improve the usability and functionality of the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint. However, it may also introduce new dependencies or requirements, such as updating the database schema or modifying the API documentation.

### Possible Risks
* The new fields may not be properly validated or sanitized, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
* The addition of new fields may break existing integrations or workflows that rely on the original endpoint behavior.
* The change may introduce performance issues if the new fields are not properly indexed or optimized.

### Migration Notes
If you are upgrading from a previous version of the system, you will need to update your code to handle the new fields. This may involve updating your API clients or modifying your database schema.

### Test Recommendations
* Test the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint with the new fields to ensure they are properly returned and validated.
* Test the endpoint with different input scenarios to ensure it handles edge cases correctly.
* Test the endpoint with existing integrations or workflows to ensure it does not break any functionality.

### Final Release Note
"Added `level`, `duration`, and `recommended` fields to the `/api/users/fetch-tests` endpoint to enhance user experience and functionality."
