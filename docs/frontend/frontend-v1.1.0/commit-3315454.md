### Commit Analysis

#### 1. High-level summary
This commit is a merge of pull request #10 from the `dauntless-arcane` repository, which updated the environment variables to include `server_api` and `schema` for input data.

#### 2. What changed
* Added `server_api` to the environment variables
* Added `schema` for input data to the environment variables

#### 3. Why it likely changed
The changes were made to accommodate the requirements of pulling data from a MongoDB database. The addition of `server_api` and `schema` for input data suggests that the system now needs to interact with a MongoDB server, which requires these specific environment variables to be set.

#### 4. Impact on system
The changes will allow the system to pull data from a MongoDB database, which may improve data retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, this may also introduce new dependencies and potential security risks if not properly configured.

#### 5. Possible risks
* Insecure configuration of MongoDB server credentials
* Insufficient error handling for MongoDB connection issues
* Potential data corruption or loss due to incorrect schema configuration

#### 6. Migration notes (if needed)
To migrate to this commit, follow these steps:
* Update environment variables to include `server_api` and `schema` for input data
* Configure MongoDB server credentials securely
* Test MongoDB connection and data retrieval functionality

#### 7. Test recommendations
* Test MongoDB connection and data retrieval functionality
* Verify that data is being pulled correctly and accurately
* Test error handling for MongoDB connection issues

#### 8. Final release note
"Updated environment variables to include server_api and schema for input data to support MongoDB data retrieval."
